        <p> Hi there! I'm Adithya, a passionate technologist with a knack for Python full-stack development.
            I recently completed my Master's in Computer Applications, diving deep into the world of software development. Along this journey, I fell in love with Python. It's not just a language; it's my toolbox for turning ideas into reality.
            During my academic tenure, I've had the privilege to work on diverse projects, from dynamic web applications to scalable backend systems. These experiences have honed my skills in front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while strengthening my backend proficiency using Python frameworks like Django or Flask.
            If you're looking for a dedicated full-stack developer with a drive to excel, I'd love to connect and explore how I can contribute to your team's success.
        </p>
